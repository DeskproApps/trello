Trello App Setup
===

To install the Trello app you must first get your client key. To do this, login to your Trello account and go to [https://trello.com/app-key](https://trello.com/app-key).

At the top of this page you'll see your client **key**, make a copy of this and store it somewhere safe.

Next, we'll need to provide Trello with your Deskpro URL. Go down to the "Allowed Origins" section and 
enter Deskpro URL in the **New Allowed Origin** field.

Click Submit to add the new allowed origin.

Head back over to Deskpro and in the **Settings** tab of the app, enter the client key you copied in the first step and 
paste it into the "Client Key" field.

To configure who can see and use the Trello app, head to the "Permissions" tab and select those users and/or groups you'd like to have access.

When you're happy, click "Install".
